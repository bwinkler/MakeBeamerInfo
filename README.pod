=head1 DESCRIPTION

Impressive is a pdf view that aids in viewing presentations made in LaTeX Beamer. Impressive uses a .info control file to specify the transitions used between pages. While is file isn't necessary, the Beamer-based presentation can be presented in a much more consistant style when the .info file is tuned to the individual presentation. C<makebeamerinfo> is designed to create this file based on an auxiliary file (.nav) that Beamer creates in parallel with the presentation. It also does not require any configuration or tags in the presentation source.
