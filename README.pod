=head1 DESCRIPTION

Impressive is a pdf viewer that aids in viewing presentations made in LaTeX Beamer. Impressive uses a .info control file to specify the transitions used between pages. While is file isn't necessary, the Beamer-based presentation can be presented in a much more consistant style when the .info file is tuned to the individual presentation. C<makebeamerinfo> is designed to create this file based on an auxiliary file (F<.nav>) that Beamer creates in parallel with the presentation. It also does not require any configuration or tags in the presentation source.
